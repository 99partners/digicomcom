# Production CORS Fix Deployment

## ðŸš¨ URGENT: Deploy These Files to Fix CORS Errors

### Files Changed:
1. `server/index.js` - Simplified CORS middleware
2. `server/routes/newsletterRoutes.js` - Removed duplicate CORS headers
3. `client/src/components/Footer.jsx` - Removed unnecessary withCredentials

### Quick Deployment Commands:

```bash
# 1. Upload fixed files to your server
scp server/index.js root@YOUR_SERVER_IP:/root/digicomcom/server/index.js
scp server/routes/newsletterRoutes.js root@YOUR_SERVER_IP:/root/digicomcom/server/routes/newsletterRoutes.js
scp client/src/components/Footer.jsx root@YOUR_SERVER_IP:/root/digicomcom/client/src/components/Footer.jsx

# 2. SSH into server and restart
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
cd /root/digicomcom
pm2 restart all

# 3. Check if it's working
curl -H "Origin: https://99digicom.com" https://api.99digicom.com/api/blogs
```

### What was fixed:
- âœ… Simplified CORS middleware - no more complex logic
- âœ… Always sets Access-Control-Allow-Origin header
- âœ… Removed duplicate header conflicts
- âœ… Works for ALL API endpoints (/api/blogs, /api/newsletter, etc.)
- âœ… Supports both https://99digicom.com and https://www.99digicom.com

### Expected Result:
After deployment, all API calls from https://99digicom.com should work without CORS errors.

### Replace YOUR_SERVER_IP with your actual server IP address.
